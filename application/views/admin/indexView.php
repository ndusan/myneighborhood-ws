				Welcome to demo simulation of webshop made by Dusan Novakovic!
				<br/><br/>
				In this admin panel you can add/edit products, check made orders, set 
				your own personal settings and send your suggestions.
				When you are ready, by clicking on link 'Your Webshop' (in top right corner) you will end up on the client side of the webshop
				where you will be able to make orders (by selecting 'products' that you created in admin panel).
				After that you can again go back to 'admin panel' and the check the orders you made.
				<br/><br/>
				My main goal here is to present both sides, administration and user, so that you can get a general idea on 
				how the application works.
				<br/><br/>
				Have fun using it!
