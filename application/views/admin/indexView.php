				Welcome to demo simulation of webshop made by Dusan Novakovic
				<br/><br/>
				In this admin panel you are able to add/edit prodacts, check made orders, set 
				your own personal settings and send some suggestions.
				When you are ready by clicking on link 'Your Webshop' you will end up on client side webshop
				where you will be able to make some orders (by selecting prodacts that you created in admin panel).
				After that you can again go back to admin panel and check those orders you made.
				<br/><br/>
				My main goal here was to present both sides, administration and user, so that you could get great picture
				how the application works.
				<br/><br/>
				Have fun using it!
